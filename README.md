## skillup

skillup provides amazing landing pages and email notifications to people hosting workshops. This is my final project for Lighthouse Labs and I will have 2 weeks time to build this MVP out from start to finish on my own!

### The Dev Process

This is both a challenging and awesome project for me because I am applying alot of what I'm learning at Lighthouse Labs as well as exploring ReactJS on my own and implementing it at the same time. Some of the stuff I'm using in my stack are:

- Ruby on Rails
- ReactJS
- AJAX
- SASS
- Custom design and stylesheets (get that bootstrap outta here)

#### More to come...

Currently still working on the project, will be shipping live in 2 weeks!
